# Tetris Devcards experiment

Just playing with [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards).

## Demo

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maio/tetris/master/resources/demo.gif)

## Live Demo

You can [try game itself](https://maio.cz/tetris/index.html) or [play with devcards](https://maio.cz/tetris/cards.html).

## Run it locally

In order to run Tetris locally, you only need Java and recent version of [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) (2.1+).

To get an interactive development environment:

    git checkout https://github.com/maio/tetris.git
    cd tetris
    lein figwheel dev cards

and open resources/public/index.html or resources/public/cards.html in your browser. Any change to source code or CSS will be pushed to the browser immediately.

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min min-cards

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not get live reloading, nor a REPL.
